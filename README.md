# yolo-object-tracking
This repository contains a project that integrates YOLOv8 from Ultralytics with OpenCV for real-time object tracking and detection. The project allows you to run the YOLOv8 model on a video file or a live camera feed, tracking objects frame by frame and visualizing the results with annotations.
